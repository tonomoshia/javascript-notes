I forked notes by Soumya (@geekysrm) and added my own edits for sections 1-15 and I am creating my own notes for sections 16 and up. 

Soumya's notes about the notes and his Notion copy of the notes (@geekysrm):

>>These are the notes I prepared for myself while taking the [Beginner JavaScript course](https://BeginnerJavaScript.com) by the one and only [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com).

>>Full notes can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/geekysrm/Beginner-JavaScript-e2ef045754d14e96b93791f638bbcaf6).
